A full stack web application for displaying statistics for a player in League of Legends for the branch of the game called ARAM. 
I created this project to learn how to learn the basics of creating both front end and back end of a web application, as well as how to use public APIs and source images from public databases. 

However since creating the project Riot API has undergone some changes which forced me to change some of the code and lose some features. Also the basic developer key that they offer is too restricted so for searching up a player with a lot of games may result in long runtimes and possibly errors (Since the new changes).
